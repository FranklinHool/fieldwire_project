Finished the basic functionality of implementing imgur images to webapp with fullscreen and scrolling refresh. In addition, the tileset is done in a masonry format where tiles are determined by image size like in pintrest. The realtime search is implemented as well, but I kept the code in for search button searching. Working on the draggables.

Used Infinite Scroll Library and FullScreen Library. 


Update:
Image loading optimizations, drag and drop interface done with saving of images, deployed on Heroku, fixed most search and scrolling issues.

Lazy loading implemented, but trying to horizontalize the masonry.
